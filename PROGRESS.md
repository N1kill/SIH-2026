# SIH-2026 Pipeline Development Progress

## Active Phase
- All Phase deliverables completed.

## Log of Changes
- **2026-09-18**: 
  - Added `config.json` incorporating Panshet Dam for generalization testing.
  - Refactored `scripts/10_hydrodynamic_simulation.py` to accept CLI `--dam_config` and ingest PySPH output.
  - Created `scripts/10a_pysph_breach_zone.py` for bounded near-field SPH simulation (CPU OpenMP).
  - Created `scripts/10b_delft3d_comparison.py` generating `.mdf`/`.grd` and handling conditional execution of `delft3d`.
  - Updated `scripts/11_gee_flood_analysis.py` with Live GEE authentication and a headless fallback.
  - Rewrote `scripts/12_validation_and_sensitivity.py` to decouple scenarios by running genuine physics simulations over base parameters.
  - Created `server.py` FastAPI backend and augmented `outputs/3d/dashboard/index.html` with a New Simulation modal, gracefully degrading to offline mode if `file:///` protocol is detected.

## Next Steps
- Verify execution of test suite or pipeline locally.
- Review and finalize documentation for submission.
